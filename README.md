# Titan's Challenge
Game Title: Titan’s Challenge
Theme & Story
In Titan’s Challenge, ancient myth meets strategy on an 8×8 board.

Player One is the lone Titan Hero, a mighty warrior imbued with ancient power who must overcome a host of adversaries to restore balance to a fractured realm.
Player Two commands the Legion of Lesser Titans—eight fierce warriors (labeled A through H) forged in the olden fires—and their supreme commander, the enigmatic Pantheon.
The Titan Hero must defeat all eight lesser Titans to gather magical emblems that reveal their hidden weaknesses before finally confronting and capturing the Pantheon. Meanwhile, the Pantheon and his legion work together to wear down the Titan Hero’s robust vitality.

Game Components & Setup
Board: Standard 8×8 grid.
Player One – Titan Hero:
Health: Starts with 75 health points.
Starting Position: A designated square (e.g., center-bottom).
Player Two – The Legion:
Lesser Titans (A–H): Positioned in a symmetric or thematic arrangement across the board.
Pantheon: Placed at a key location (e.g., center-top) as the final objective.
Movement Rules
Titan Hero (Player One)
Range: Can move up to 3 squares per turn.
Directions: May move in any direction—including orthogonal and diagonal.
Jumping: Can “jump” over any pieces (allies or enemies); obstacles do not block movement.
Restrictions:
The Titan Hero cannot land on the Pantheon until all eight Lesser Titans have been defeated.
Landing on a square occupied by a Lesser Titan initiates combat (see next section).
Lesser Titans & Pantheon (Player Two)
Range: Each enemy piece moves exactly 1 square per turn.
Directions: They can move in any direction, including diagonally.
Collisions:
Enemy pieces cannot move onto squares occupied by one another.
Lesser Titans may move onto the Titan Hero’s square to initiate combat.
The Pantheon is forbidden from moving onto the Titan Hero.
Combat & Damage Mechanics
When the Titan Hero Confronts a Lesser Titan
Default Damage:
If the Titan Hero lands on (or is engaged by) a Lesser Titan, he suffers 8 damage points.
Emblem System:
Defeating a Lesser Titan grants the Titan Hero a unique emblem.
These emblems form a cyclical chain of weaknesses:
For example, the emblem from Titan A reduces the damage when facing Titan B; Titan B’s emblem helps against Titan C, and so on—with Titan H’s emblem effective against Titan A.
Effective Combat: If the Titan Hero has the appropriate emblem for the opponent, he only takes 3 damage points.
Removal: The confronted Lesser Titan is removed from the board once engaged.
Pantheon’s Divine Smite
After Player Two’s Turn:
If the Pantheon is in a clear line of sight (row, column, or even diagonal, if you wish to expand its range) with the Titan Hero—with no other pieces blocking the view—it unleashes a divine smite, inflicting 3 additional damage points on the Titan Hero.
End-of-Turn Attrition
Titan Hero’s Energy Drain:
At the end of every Titan Hero turn (if the game hasn’t ended), he loses 1 health point—symbolizing the toll of the ancient curse that afflicts him.
Special Abilities & Optional Variants
Titan Hero – Ground Smash:
Once every 5 turns, the Titan Hero can perform a Ground Smash that affects all enemy pieces in the immediately adjacent squares (up, down, left, right, and diagonally).
Any enemy caught in the smash might be forced to retreat or suffer additional damage (a variant rule to add tactical flair).
Lesser Titans’ Unique Traits:
(Optional) Each Lesser Titan could have a slight bias in movement or a special “charge” attack when near the Titan Hero, representing their unique mythic origins.
Pantheon’s Mobility:
(Optional) The Pantheon might occasionally “shift” to a neighboring square if not in direct combat, representing divine foresight.
Victory Conditions
Player One (Titan Hero) Wins:
After defeating all eight Lesser Titans (thus collecting all emblems), the Titan Hero can then legally move onto the Pantheon’s square. Capturing the Pantheon immediately wins the game.
Player Two (Legion) Wins:
If the Titan Hero’s health is reduced to 0 (or below) before he can capture the Pantheon, the forces of the Pantheon prevail.
Summary
Titan’s Challenge is a strategic duel where Player One must carefully navigate the board, managing both movement and health while planning an efficient route through enemy forces—making full use of the emblem system to minimize damage. Player Two, meanwhile, must coordinate the movements of the eight Lesser Titans and strategically position the Pantheon to maximize the inflicted damage, aiming to drain the Titan Hero’s vitality over time.

This concept provides ample opportunities to explore depth in tactics, risk management, and asymmetric gameplay—offering a fresh twist on chess-like strategy with a mythic narrative flavor.
